## Camera Installation

### Physical Connection

#### Step 1: Identify CSI Ports

The Jetson Orin Nano has **2 CSI camera ports**:
- **CAM0:** Camera Port 0 (closest to the heat sink)
- **CAM1:** Camera Port 1

#### Step 2: Connect Cameras

1. **Power off the Jetson** completely
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -h now
   ```

2. **Connect Camera 1 to CAM0:**
   - Gently lift the CSI port latch
   - Insert the camera ribbon cable with contacts facing inward (toward the heat sink)
   - Ensure cable is fully inserted
   - Press down the latch to secure

3. **Connect Camera 2 to CAM1:**
   - Repeat the process for the second CSI port
   - Ensure both cables are securely locked

4. **Verify connections:**
   - Cables should be firmly seated
   - Latches fully closed
   - No visible gaps between cable and connector

#### Step 3: Camera Mounting

For football field recording:
- Mount cameras side-by-side with appropriate spacing
- Align cameras to cover both goal areas
- Ensure stable mounting to prevent vibration
- Consider weather protection for outdoor use

### Camera Detection

After powering on the Jetson:

1. **Check camera devices:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /dev/video*
   ```

   Expected output (may vary):
   ```
   /dev/video0
   /dev/video1
   /dev/video2
   /dev/video3
   ...
   ```

   **Note:** Multiple video devices per camera is normal. FootballVision Pro uses `/dev/video0` and `/dev/video1` by default.

2. **Verify camera access permissions:**
   ```bash
   ls -la /dev/video0
   ```

   Should show `crw-rw----+ 1 root video ...`

3. **Ensure user is in video group:**
   ```bash
   groups | grep video
   ```

   If not in video group:
   ```bash
   sudo usermod -aG video $USER
   # Log out and back in for changes to take effect
   ```

### Camera Daemon

The `nvargus-daemon` service is critical for camera operation:

```bash
# Check daemon status
sudo systemctl status nvargus-daemon

# Restart if needed
sudo systemctl restart nvargus-daemon

# Enable at boot
sudo systemctl enable nvargus-daemon
```

**Important:** If cameras fail to initialize, restarting nvargus-daemon usually resolves the issue.
