# Quality Gates Checklist
## FootballVision Pro - Testing & Release Control

## Overview
Quality gates are mandatory checkpoints that must be passed before code progression. **NO EXCEPTIONS** for gate failures - quality is non-negotiable for a system that must never lose a match recording.

## Gate 1: Code Commit Gate

### Automated Checks (Pre-commit Hooks)

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets

### Developer Checklist
- [ ] Unit tests written for new code
- [ ] Existing tests still pass
