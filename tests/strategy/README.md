# Test Strategy - W41
## FootballVision Pro Quality Assurance

## Overview
This directory contains the master test strategy and quality control framework for FootballVision Pro. As the Test Strategy Lead (W41), this defines the comprehensive testing approach that ensures zero-failure reliability for match recordings.

## Contents

### [MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md](./MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md)
The complete test strategy document covering:
- Test requirements matrix (functional, performance, reliability)
- Quality gates definition
- Release criteria (Alpha, Beta, Production)
- Risk management framework
- Test execution schedule
- Metrics and KPIs
- Tools and frameworks
- Team coordination

### [QUALITY_GATES.md](./QUALITY_GATES.md)
Detailed checklist for all 10 quality gates:
1. Code Commit Gate
2. Pull Request Gate
3. Integration Gate
4. Performance Gate
5. Field Readiness Gate
6. Documentation Gate
7. Deployment Gate
8. Monitoring Gate
9. Release Gate
10. Production Validation Gate

## Key Principles

### 1. Zero-Failure Mandate
Recording must NEVER fail during a match. All testing is designed around this non-negotiable requirement.

### 2. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of testing ensure issues are caught early:
- Unit tests (developers)
- Integration tests (W42)
- Performance tests (W43)
- Field tests (W44)
- Production monitoring (W47)

### 3. Test Automation
Automate everything possible to enable:
- Fast feedback loops
- Consistent execution
- Regression prevention
- Continuous validation

### 4. Real-World Focus
Lab tests are necessary but not sufficient. Field testing with:
- Real users (non-technical)
- Real environments (clubs, weather)
- Real conditions (network issues, power fluctuations)

## Quick Reference

### Release Criteria Summary
```yaml
Alpha:
  - Core recording: 90 minutes successful
  - Basic UI: Functional
  - Manual testing: 100% pass

Beta:
  - All features: Complete
  - Automated tests: >90% pass
  - Field matches: 10+ successful
  - Documentation: Draft complete

Production:
  - P0 bugs: ZERO
  - Field matches: 50+ successful
  - All benchmarks: MET
  - Documentation: Complete with videos
  - Installer: One-click working
```

### Critical Metrics
| Metric | Target | Non-Negotiable |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Recording success rate | 100% | YES |
| Frame drops | 0 | YES |
| System temperature | <75°C | YES |
| Boot time | <30s | NO |
| Processing time | <2x real-time | NO |
| Uptime | >99.5% | YES |

## Test Execution

### Running Full Test Suite
```bash
# From repository root
pytest tests/ -v --cov=src --cov-report=html

# With parallel execution
pytest tests/ -v -n auto --cov=src

# Performance tests only
pytest tests/performance/ -v --benchmark-only

# Integration tests only
pytest tests/integration/ -v --tb=short
```

### Pre-Release Checklist
```bash
# 1. Run all automated tests
./tests/scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# 2. Check code coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# 3. Run performance benchmarks
pytest tests/performance/ --benchmark-save=release

# 4. Validate deployment package
./deployment/validator.py

# 5. Generate release report
python tests/strategy/generate_report.py
```

## Risk Management

### Top 5 Risks (See MASTER_TEST_PLAN.md for full details)
1. **Recording failure during match** - Impact: Critical
2. **Thermal throttling** - Impact: High
3. **Network upload failure** - Impact: Medium
4. **User error** - Impact: Medium
5. **Hardware failure** - Impact: Critical

Each risk has defined mitigation strategies and contingency plans.
