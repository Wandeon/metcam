## Quick Start

**For experienced users on a fresh Jetson Orin Nano:**

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/footballvision-pro.git
cd footballvision-pro

# Run complete installation (takes ~10 minutes)
chmod +x deploy/install-complete.sh
./deploy/install-complete.sh

# After installation completes:
# 1. Log out and back in (if added to video group)
# 2. Restart camera daemon: sudo systemctl restart nvargus-daemon
# 3. Access UI at http://<your-jetson-ip>
```

---

## Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements

- **NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano** (8GB recommended)
- **2x IMX477 cameras** connected via CSI ports
- **32GB+ microSD card** or NVMe SSD
- **Network connection** for installation

### Software Requirements

- **JetPack 6.1+** installed and running
- **Ubuntu 22.04** (comes with JetPack)
- **Internet connection** during installation
- **sudo access**

### Pre-Installation Checks

Verify your hardware before starting:

```bash
# Check JetPack version
dpkg -l | grep nvidia-jetpack

# Check cameras are detected
ls -la /dev/video*
# Should show at least 2 video devices

# Check available disk space (need at least 10GB)
df -h /

# Verify you have sudo access
sudo whoami
```

---

## Installation

### Method 1: Automated Installation (Recommended)

The complete installation script handles everything automatically:

```bash
# Navigate to repository
cd footballvision-pro

# Run installation
./deploy/install-complete.sh
```

**What the script does:**

1. ✅ Verifies hardware and JetPack version
2. ✅ Installs all system dependencies (GStreamer, Python, etc.)
3. ✅ Installs Caddy web server
4. ✅ Installs Node.js 20+ if needed
5. ✅ Installs Python dependencies
6. ✅ Creates required directories with correct permissions
7. ✅ Adds user to video group for camera access
8. ✅ Builds and deploys web dashboard
9. ✅ Configures and starts Caddy web server
10. ✅ Installs and starts API service

**Installation time:** Approximately 10-15 minutes depending on network speed.

### Method 2: Manual Installation

If you prefer manual control, see [MANUAL_INSTALL.md](MANUAL_INSTALL.md) for step-by-step instructions.

## Validation

After installation, validate your system:

### 1. System Validation

Run the comprehensive validation script:

```bash
./deploy/validate.sh
```

This checks:
- Hardware detection
- Required directories and permissions
- System packages and Python dependencies
- Camera availability
- Services (API, Caddy, nvargus-daemon)
- API endpoints
- GStreamer plugins
- Web UI deployment

**Expected output:** All checks should pass (green ✓). Warnings are acceptable, failures must be addressed.

### 2. Quick Functionality Test

Test preview and recording functionality:

```bash
./deploy/quick-test.sh
```

This performs:
- API status check
- Pipeline state verification
- Preview start/stop test
- HLS segment generation verification
- Recording start/stop test
- Mutual exclusion verification (recording blocks preview)

**Expected output:** All tests should pass. Small test recordings will be created in `/mnt/recordings/`.

### 3. Performance Test

Validate system performance:

```bash
./deploy/performance-test.sh
```

This measures:
- HLS segment generation rate
- CPU usage during preview and recording
- Recording framerate analysis
- System resource availability

**Expected results:**
- Preview: 30fps for both cameras
- Recording: 25-30fps for both cameras at 12Mbps
- CPU usage: 250-350% during recording (2-3 cores)

## Post-Installation

### Required Steps

1. **Log out and back in** (if you were added to the video group)
   ```bash
   # Check if you're in video group
   groups | grep video

   # If not, log out and back in
   exit
   ```

2. **Restart camera daemon**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nvargus-daemon
   ```

3. **Verify services are running**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status footballvision-api-enhanced
   sudo systemctl status caddy
   ```

### Access the System

1. **Find your Jetson's IP address**
   ```bash
   hostname -I
   ```

2. **Open web UI in browser**
   ```
   http://<your-jetson-ip>
   ```

3. **Test preview stream**
   - Click "Start Preview" in the web UI
   - You should see live video from both cameras
   - Click "Stop Preview" when done

4. **Test recording**
   - Preview MUST be stopped before recording
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - Enter match details
   - Recording files will be saved to `/mnt/recordings/<match_id>/`

### Useful Commands

```bash
# View API logs (real-time)
journalctl -u footballvision-api-enhanced -f

# View Caddy logs
journalctl -u caddy -f

# Check pipeline state
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pipeline-state

# Check system status
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/status

# Restart API service
sudo systemctl restart footballvision-api-enhanced

# Restart Caddy
sudo systemctl restart caddy

# List recordings
ls -lh /mnt/recordings/
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. "Failed to create CaptureSession" errors

**Cause:** Camera daemon (nvargus-daemon) in bad state

**Solution:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart nvargus-daemon
sudo systemctl restart footballvision-api-enhanced
```

#### 2. Web UI shows 502 Bad Gateway

**Cause:** API service not running or crashed

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status footballvision-api-enhanced

# View recent logs
journalctl -u footballvision-api-enhanced -n 50

# Restart service
sudo systemctl restart footballvision-api-enhanced
```

#### 3. Cameras not detected

**Cause:** User not in video group or cameras not connected properly

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check cameras
ls -la /dev/video*

# Add to video group if needed
sudo usermod -aG video $USER
# Then log out and back in

# Check physical connections
# Cameras should be firmly connected to CSI ports
```

#### 4. Preview/Recording won't start

**Cause:** Pipeline locked by previous operation

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check pipeline state
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/pipeline-state

# If stuck, restart API service
sudo systemctl restart footballvision-api-enhanced
```

#### 5. Low framerate during recording

**Cause:** CPU overwhelmed or both preview and recording running

**Solution:**
- Ensure preview is stopped before starting recording
- Check CPU usage: `top` or `htop`
- Expected CPU usage during recording: 250-350%
- If using barrel correction, disable it for better performance

### Getting Help

1. **Check logs:**
   ```bash
   journalctl -u footballvision-api-enhanced -n 100
   ```

2. **Run validation:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy/validate.sh
   ```

3. **Review documentation:**
   - [TROUBLESHOOTING.md](../docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md)
   - [HARDWARE_SETUP.md](../docs/HARDWARE_SETUP.md)
